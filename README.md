# French-Revision-PYTHON
My French Revision Helper program but written in python cuz learning new things is never a bad thing and also the C one wasn't going too well trying to link it with the SQL server.
List of things that need to happen for this to work:
1- Some system that keeps track of: Verbs, Adjectives, Nouns, Rules locally
2- Some system to communicate with SQL server
3- Some GUI

Probably will start with the 1st and 3rd because if it's anything like the C project, 2 is gonna b a pain.
