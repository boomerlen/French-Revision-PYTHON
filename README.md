# French-Revision-PYTHON
My French Revision Helper program but written in python cuz learning new things is never a bad thing and also the C one wasn't going too well trying to link it with the SQL server.
List of things that need to happen for this to work:
1- Some system that keeps track of: Verbs, Adjectives, Nouns, Rules locally DONE
2- Some system to communicate with SQL server DONE
3- Some GUI TODO

Now all that's left is the GUI which is currently WIP

Dependencies:
MySQLdb (mysqlclient), tkinter
